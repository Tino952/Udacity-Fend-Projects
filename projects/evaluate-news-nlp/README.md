# Natural Language Processing Project

## Rationale

The aim of this project is to build a client and server-side architecture in order to interact with the Meaning Cloud API
using RESTful services. I have decided to implement the summarizing functionality provided by the Meaning Cloud API.

Furthermore, the idea of this project is to use Webpack in order to develop and ultimately compile the code.

In addition to using the Jest plugin in order to test methods running on the client-side js script, I have also decided to implement the JOI plugin in order to verify user input.

The Meaning Cloud API uses a natural language processing algorithm to shorten long texts to a desired length while attempting
to include only the most pertinent details from the text.

## Using SummarizeMe

First, select a URL with a text that you wish to summarize. Past this URL into the designated input-field in the UI and
finally select within how many sentences you would like the summary to be generated.

Your summary will appear in the output-box below.
