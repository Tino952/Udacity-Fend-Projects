## Additional Information

Throughout my projects, I tried to adhere to SMACSS and BEM principles for my css styling. Css files are separated into the following:

* Styles - import of all stylesheets below
* Reset - total reset of all css elements
* Global - mainly used for defining SCSS variables like "primary color" or "secondary font"
* Base - general element styling
* Layout - styling of main, section or sidebar
* Module - bulk of code, individual modules contained in layout
* Theme - any particular themes applied to the entirety of the web app
* Header - header styling
* Footer - footer styling
